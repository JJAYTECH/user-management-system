# user-management-system-frontend
Group Project Activity: Full-Stack Application Development - FRONTEND(Angular.js)


## Introduction
The **User Management System** is a web-based application designed to streamline user authentication, authorization, and account management. It provides a secure and efficient way to handle user registration, authentication, and role-based access control. 

Built with **Node.js** and **MySQL** for the backend and **Angular** for the frontend, this system ensures a seamless experience for both users and administrators. Key features include JWT authentication, email verification, password recovery, profile management, and an admin dashboard for managing user accounts. Additionally, a fake backend implementation is available to facilitate development and testing without requiring a live backend.

A fully functional Angular boilerplate app runs with email sign-up and verification, JWT authentication with fresh tokens, Role-based authorization, Profile management, Admin dashboard, and Fake backend implementation for backend-less development. 

This project is developed by:
- **Clint Brian Castillo**
- **Ivan Rey Langomez**
